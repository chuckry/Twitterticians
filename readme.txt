This is my readme for twit.py

Instructions:

Place all files in the same directory, then run twit.py on terminal.

You will get a CSV file in Excel with the outputs for the 100 tweets for each celebrity.
This will have a positive, negative, and overall score in the table.

I computed a line graph to check whether there is any correlation between position in the top 50 most powerful celebrity list
by Forbes and how positive the associated hashtags are.

We are passing in a list of the top 50 celebrities, and getting the most associated tags with them in our list.txt.
