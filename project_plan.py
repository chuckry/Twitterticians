#####Part I. Describe your project #####

# Include:
# a.	What data sources you will use    
# b.	How you plan to process the data you will get.     
# c.	How you will present the results.

      a. My data source will be the gameplay itself, where I will have accumulation and sort patterns to print out a results screen after each game and show the highest scores.
 
      b.  I plan to process the data to a text or CSV file, before which it will be sorted. I plan to use the write and read methods, as well as the CSV creation methods we've learned
 
      c.  I will present the results in the terminal itself, or in a text file. I am also thinking of presenting it on the game board itself.
